rubber: rubber tree -> tree tap -> bucket of latex -> a or b -> cleaned -> dried -> vulcanization

a: bucket of latex + rope -> bucket of coagulated rubber
b: bucket of latex -> c or d -> bucket of coagulated rubber

c: bucket of latex + purified formic acid
d: bucket of latex + sodium bisulfate

dried: bucket of clean coagulated rubber + rope -> untreated rubber
vulcanization: untreated rubber + sulfur -> rubber

purified formic acid: e or f -> purification chamber

e: methanol + carbon monoxide (in heated environment) -> watered formic acid + hydrogen gas -> distilled (formic acid)
f: stung by bee whilst holding glass bottle in hand

sodium bisulfate: sodium carbonate + sulfuric acid (in heated environment) -> watered sodium bisulfate -> filtration or centifugation (dirty sodium bisulfate) -> washed (clean sodium bisulfate) -> dried

methanol: steam reformation or gasification
carbon monoxide: steam reformation -> carbon monoxide + hydrogen

sodium carbonate: g or h -> filtration or centrifugation (dirty sodium carbonate) -> washed (clean sodium carbonate) -> dried
g: sodium chloride (salt) + ammonia + carbon dioxide (in heated environment) -> sodium carbonate + calcium chloride + water
h: trona ore or nahcolite -> crushing (crushed) -> smelted (ingot) -> crystallization (crystallized)

ammonia: steam reformation -> distillation -> reactor (with nitrogen gas) -> purified
carbon dioxide: i or j

i: burning of fossil fuels or fermentation of sugar
j: k or l or m

k: adsorbed onto the surfaced of activated charcoal or zeolite 
l: dissolved in water or monoethanolamine
m: air is cooled -> compressed (liquid air) -> heated (liquid carbon dioxide)

activated charcoal: n or o or p

n: steam activation (charcoal + steam at high temperature)
o: chemical activation (charcoal + phosphoric acid or zinc chloride)
p: high temperature activation (charcoal + oxygen at high temperature)

phosphoric acid: sulfuric acid + phosphate ore (liquid phosphoric acid) -> filtration or centrifugation (inpure phosphoric acid) -> purification chamber
zinc chloride: q or u

q: zinc + hydrochloric acid -> zinc chloride + hydrogen gas
u: zinc metal + hydrochloric acid -> unpure zinc chloride -> crystalized

hydrochloric acid: hydrogen gas + chlorine gas using chloralkali electrolysis cell

zeolite: clinoptilolite, chabazite, or mordenite (naturally occuring minerals)

monoethanolamine: ethylene oxide + ammonia + water -> inpure monoethanolamine + hydrogen gas -> distillation
ethylene oxide: ethylene + oxygen (in presence of silver or platinum catalyst)
ethylene: steam cracking of ethane (produced from natural gas) (heating ethane in the presence of steam)

sulfuric acid: sulfur dioxide + oxygen (in presence of platinum or vanadium pentoxide catalyst) -> sulfur trioxde -> sulfur trioxide + water
sulfur dioxide: smelting of sulfide ores or byproduct or burning fossil fuels
vanadium pentoxide: roasting of vanadinite, carnotite, or patronite (inpure vanadium pentoxide) -> leached (purified)
